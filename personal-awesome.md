- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) A great replacement for cat with syntax highlighting, themes, and more.
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) 'exa' is a modern replacement for 'ls'. I like it because of the pretty colors and the glyphs/icons.
- [micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) An excellent text editor for those that haven't embraced 'vim' or 'emacs' yet. Uses familiar keystrokes like ctrl+f, ctrl+s, etc.
- [spacevim](https://spacevim.org/) 'vim' framework that makes your leader key your spacebar, hence the name `spacevim`. Lots of options. 
- [spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) The best editor is neither `vim` nor `emacs`. Has a learning curve, but it's worth it.
