# My Opinionated Awesome List

## What are Awesome lists?
If you aren't familiar with[Awesome lists](https://www.github.com/sindresorhus/awesome "Awesome"), you're missing out.  Awesome lists are curated lists of awesome things on a particular topic or field.  I won't spoil the fun, but if you're anything like me, you will soon find yourself losing countless hours discovering new things you had no idea were so... awesome!

## What is this list?
This is my personal list of awesome things. A lot of the things in my list were found by browsing through the gargantuan volume of things in the all of the other lists, but there's a lot of stuff in here that I've found on my own that isn't listed elsewhere.

Maybe in time this will become a certified Awesome list itself. But in the meantime, I just wanted a place to catalog topics that I'm interested in and would like to learn more about, as well things that I use while I'm interfacing with a computer.

## Who are you?  Why should I care?
I am nobody of any level of importance, skill, or reputation. I'm just autodidact with a passion for computers and learning. And I think I have a pretty keen sense of what's good and what's not. But maybe you'll disagree! That's why this is my _opinionated_ Awesome list. ;)

If you happen to stumble across this repo and would like to flame me for my poor taste in _<insert thing here>_, feel free. Or, better yet, tell me about more awesome things that you yourself find awesome so that other can learn of the awesomeness and in turn make the world a more awesome place.
